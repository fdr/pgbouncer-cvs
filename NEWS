2008-xx-xx  -  PgBouncer 1.2.4  -  ""

  * Allow '.' and '-' in database names (Alberto De Boni)
  * Put ./include at the start of CPPFLAGS (Bjorn Munch)
  * --enable-debug is now default (unstripped binary)
  * --disable-debug does not add -fomit-frame-pointer anymore

2008-08-08  -  PgBouncer 1.2.3  -  "Carefully Selected Bytes"

  * Disable SO_ACCEPTFILTER code for BSDs which did not work.
  * Include example etc/userlist.txt in tgz.
  * Use '$(MAKE)' instead 'make' for recursion (Jørgen Austvik)
  * Define _GNU_SOURCE as glibc is useless otherwise.
  * Let the libevent 1.1 pass link test so we can later report "1.3b+ needed"
  * Detect stale pidfile and remove it.

  Thanks to Devrim GÜNDÜZ and Bjoern Metzdorf for problem reports and testing.

2008-08-06  -  PgBouncer 1.2.2  -  "Barf-bag Included"

  * Remove 'drop_on_error', it was a bad idea.  It was added as workaround
    for broken plan cache behaviour in Postgres, but can cause damage
    in common case when some queries always return error.

2008-08-04  -  PgBouncer 1.2.1  -  "Waterproof"

  = Features =

    * New parameter 'drop_on_error' - if server throws error the connection
      will not be reused but dropped after client finished with it.  This is
      needed to refresh plan cache.  Automatic refresh does not work even in 8.3.
      Defaults to 1.

  = Fixes =

    * SHOW SOCKETS/CLIENTS/SERVERS: Don't crash if socket has no buffer.
    * Fix infinite loop on SUSPEND if suspend_timeout triggers.

  = Minor cleanups =

    * Use <sys/uio.h> for 'struct iovec'.
    * Cancel shutdown (from SIGINT) on RESUME/SIGUSR2,
      otherwise it will trigger on next PAUSE.
    * Proper log message if console operation is canceled.

2008-07-29  -  PgBouncer 1.2  -  "Ordinary Magic Flute"

  PgBouncer 1.2 now requires libevent version 1.3b or newer.
  Older libevent versions crash with new restart code.

  = Features =

    * Command line option (-u) and config parameter (user=) to support user
      switching at startup.  Also now pgbouncer refuses to run as root.
      (Jacob Coby)
    * More descriptive usage text (-h).  (Jacob Coby)
    * New database option: connect_query to allow run a query on new
      connections before they are taken into use.  (Teodor Sigaev)
    * New config var 'ignore_startup_parameters' to allow and ignore
      extra parameters in startup packet.  By default only 'database'
      and 'user' are allowed, all others raise error.  This is needed
      to tolerate overenthusiastic JDBC wanting to unconditionally
      set 'extra_float_digits=2' in startup packet.
    * Logging to syslog: new parameters syslog=0/1 and
      syslog_facility=daemon/user/local0.
    * Less scary online restart (-R)
      - Move FD loading before fork, so it logs to console and can be canceled by ^C
      - Keep SHUTDOWN after fork, so ^C would be safe
      - A connect() is attempted to unix socket to see if anyone is listening.
        Now -R can be used even when no previous process was running.  If there
        is previous process, but -R is not used, startup fails.
    * New console commands:
      - SHOW TOTALS that shows stats summary (as goes to log) plus mem usage.
      - SHOW ACTIVE_SOCKETS - like show sockets; but filter only active ones.

  = Less visible features =

    * suspend_timeout - drop stalled conns and long logins. This brings
      additional safety to reboot.
    * When remote database throws error on logging in, notify clients.
    * Removing a database from config and reloading works - all connections
      are killed and the database is removed.
    * Fake some parameters on console SHOW/SET commands to be more Postgres-like.
      That was needed to allow psycopg to connect to console.
      (client_encoding/default_transaction_isolation/datestyle/timezone)
    * Make server_lifetime=0 disconnect server connection immediately
      after first use.  Previously "0" made PgBouncer ignore server age.
      As this behavior was undocumented, there should not be any users
      depending on it.
    * Internal improvements:
      - Packet buffers are allocated lazily and reused.  This should bring
        huge decrease in memory usage.  This also makes realistic to use
        big pktbuf with lot of connections.
      - Lot's of error handling improvements, PgBouncer should now
        survive OOM situations gracefully.
      - Use slab allocator for memory management.
      - Lots of code cleanups.

  = Fixes =

    * Only single accept() was issued per event loop which could
      cause connection backlog when having high amount of connection
      attempts.  Now the listening socket is always drained fully,
      which should fix this.
    * Handle EINTR from connect().
    * Make configure.ac compatible with autoconf 2.59.
    * Solaris compatibility fixes (Magne Mæhre)

2007-12-10  -  PgBouncer 1.1.2  -  "The Hammer"

  = Features =

    * Disconnects because of server_lifetime are now separated by
      (server_lifetime / pool_size) seconds.  This avoids pgbouncer
      causing reconnect floods.

  = Fixes =

    * Online upgrade 1.0 -> 1.1 problems:
      - 1.0 does not track server parameters, so they stay NULL
        but 1.1 did not expect it and crashed.
      - If server params are unknown, but client ones are set,
        then issue a SET for them, instead complaining.
    * Remove temp debug statements that were accidentally left
      in code on INFO level, so they polluted logs.
    * Unbroke debian/changelog

  = Cleanup =

    * reorder struct SBuf fields to get better alignment for buffer.

2007-10-26  -  PgBouncer 1.1.1  -  "Breakdancing Bee"

  = Fixes =

  * Server parameter cache could stay uninitialized, which caused
    unnecessary SET of them.  This caused problem on 8.1 which
    does not allow touching standard_conforming_strings.
    (Thanks to Dimitri Fontaine for report & testing.)

  * Some doc fixes.
  * Include doc/fixman.py in .tgz.

2007-10-09  -  PgBouncer 1.1  -  "Mad-Hat Toolbox"

  = Features =

  * Keep track of following server parameters:

      client_encoding  datestyle, timezone, standard_conforming_strings

  * Database connect string enhancements:
    - Accept hostname in host=
    - Accept custom unix socket location in host=
    - Accept quoted values: password=' asd''foo'

  * New config var: server_reset_query, to be sent immidiately after release
  * New config var: server_round_robin, to switch between LIFO and RR.
  * Cancel pkt sent for idle connection does not drop it anymore.
  * Cancel with ^C from psql works for SUSPEND / PAUSE.
  * Print FD limits on startup.
  * When suspending, try to hit packet boundary ASAP.
  * Add 'timezone' to database parameters.
  * Use longlived logfile fd.  Reopened on SIGHUP / RELOAD;
  * Local connection endpoint info in SHOW SERVERS/CLIENTS/SOCKETS.

  = Code cleanup =

  * More debug log messages include socket info.
  * Magic number removal and error message cleanup. (David Fetter)
  * Wrapper struct for current pkt info.  Removes lot of compexity.

  = Fixes =

  * Detect invalid pkt headers better.
  * auth_file modification check was broken, which made pgbouncer
    reload it too often.

2007-06-18  -  PgBouncer 1.0.8  -  "Undead Shovel Jutsu"

  = Fixes =

  * Fix crash in cancel packet handling. (^C from psql)

  = Features =

  * PAUSE <db>; RESUME <db>; works now.
  * Cleanup of console command parsing.
  * Disable expensive in-list assert check.

2007-04-19  -  PgBouncer 1.0.7  -  "With Vitamin A-Z"

  * Several error/notice packets with send() blocking between
    triggered assert.  Fix it by removing flushing logic altogether.
    As pgbouncer does not actively buffer anything, its not needed.
    It was a remnant from the time when buffering was pushed to
    kernel with MSG_MORE.
  * Additionally avoid calling recv() logic when sending unblocks.
  * List search code for admin_users and stats_users
    mishandled partial finds.  Fix it.
  * Standardise UNIX socket peer UID finding to getpeereid().

2007-04-12  -  PgBouncer 1.0.6  -  "Daily Dose"

  * The "Disable maintenance during the takeover" fix could
    disable maintenance altogether.  Fix it.
  * Compilation fix for FreeBSD, <sys/ucred.h> requires <sys/param.h> there.
    Thanks go to Robert Gogolok for report.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.5  -  "Enough for today"

  * Fix online-restart bugs:
    - Set ->ready for idle servers.
    - Remove obsolete code from use_client_socket()
    - Disable maintenance during the takeover.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.4  -  "Last 'last' bug"

  * Notice from idle server tagged server dirty.
    release_server() did not expect it.  Fix it
    by dropping them.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.3  -  "Fearless Fork"

  = Fixes =

  * Some error handling was missing in login path, so dying
    connection there could trigger asserts.
  * Cleanup of asserts in sbuf.c to catch problems earlier.
  * Create core when Assert() triggers.

  = New stuff =

  * New config vars: log_connections, log_disconnections,
    log_pooler_errors to turn on/off noise.
  * Config var: client_login_timeout to kill dead connections
    in login phase that could stall SUSPEND and thus online restart.

2007-03-28  -  PgBouncer 1.0.2  -  "Supersonic Spoon"

  * libevent may report a deleted event inside same loop.
    Avoid socket reuse for one loop.
  * release_server() from disconnect_client() didnt look
    it the packet was actually sent.

2007-03-15  -  PgBouncer 1.0.1  -  "Alien technology"

  = Fixes =

  * Mixed usage of cached and non-cached time, plus unsiged usec_t typedef
    created spurious query_timeout errors.
  * Fix rare case when socket woken up from send-wait could stay stalling.
  * More fair queueing of server connections.  Before, a new query could
    get a server connections before older one.
  * Delay server release until everything is guaranteed to be sent.

  = Features =

  * SHOW SOCKETS command to have detailed info about state state.
  * Put PgSocket ptr to log, to help tracking one connection.
  * In console, allow SELECT in place of SHOW.
  * Various code cleanups.

2007-03-13  -  PgBouncer 1.0  -  "Tuunitud bemm"

  * First public release.
